# Advanced Software Development Project

Building a server-side project from top to bottom, which gets search problems from the client and returns the "best" solution according to the search algorithms.<br />
While using the following elements:

  - Having an emphasis on the right use on Solid, Grasp and Design Patterns principles.
  - An extended use in Java Generics.
  - Building a Server, Cache Manager and a Client Handler as interfaces,opened to a variety of uses by demand.
  - Building a variety of algorithms such as BestFirstSearch, BFS and DFS in order to solve several problems.
  - Building a single Adapter for the project, in order to solve different unexpected problems.


**This project was made for my Advanced Software Development Course, Which was taught by Dr. Eliahu Khalastchi<br /> at The College of Management Academic Studies .<br />
This project was written by me with the personal guidance of Gil Yermiyah ([gilyerm](https://github.com/gilyerm)).**
